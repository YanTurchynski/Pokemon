# Pokemon

## Project Description

This project focuses on applying Java Streams to process data retrieved from the Pokémon API. Working in pairs, we explored functional programming concepts by performing a variety of data manipulation and analysis tasks on Pokémon attributes.
Each Pokémon in the dataset is described by its:
•	Name
•	Base Experience
•	Height
•	Weight
•	Stats: HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed
Our goal was to perform the following operations using Java Streams:
1.	Find the Pokémon type with the highest average base experience
2.	Calculate the total weight per Pokémon type
3.	List all Pokémon names where height exceeds a given threshold
4.	Find the top 3 Pokémon with the highest attack stat
5.	Calculate the percentage of Pokémon above the average speed
6.	Create a map from Pokémon type to a set of unique abilities, then serialize and save to JSON
7.	Find the average attack for Pokémon weighing more than 2000 units
8.	Generate a sorted list of Pokémon names in uppercase
9.	Find the Pokémon with the largest difference between attack and defense stats
10.	Partition Pokémon into legendary and non-legendary groups, then serialize and save to JSON
